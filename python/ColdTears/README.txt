pylcdsysinfo
============

Python interface to Coldtears' LCD Sys Info device (http://www.coldtears.com/electronics/)

**Note:** On some Linux platforms like Ubuntu only root has write permission
to usb devices unless permission is is given to other users.
You may need to copy the provided `99-lcdsysinfo.rules` file into
`/etc/udev/rules.d/` in order to grant pylcdsysinfo permission to claim the
device without running as root. Example:

    sudo cp 99-lcdsysinfo.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

If the screen is already plugged in, unplug and plug back in again after the
copy.

pylcdsysinfo relies on the Python usb library http://pyusb.sourceforge.net/
this can be installed via pip/easy_install, Example:

    pip install pyusb

or through the distribution specific package install, example for Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt-get install python-usb

**Note:** using the operating system packages is likely to install an old version.

For Windows an additional step is required, a usb driver is required to allow the
python usb library to talk with the display. A signed driver for Windows 7 (and XP)
64 and 32 bit can be installed by using zadig_v2.0.1.160 from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/ ensure the LCD device is
**not** plugged in, run zadig, insert the device, change the driver to
`libusb-win32` and hit install. libusb-win32 version 1.2.4.0 from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.4.0/ 
is also known to work under Windows XP, with Python 2.6.4 and python usb 1.0.
