This is a very quick thing that I wrote up to get the latest
weather information for my area.

getweather is a script that goes out www.weather.gov and grabs the current
weather alerts for my area, as well as the current obseration.

getalert.pl is a simple script that pulls out the alert information from
the XML.

getweather.pl is a simple perl script that pulls out the weather information
from the XML.

The output of both go into 3rd and 4th lines of the Pertelian.
