Older bootloaders do not properly reset the watchdog hardware on startup 
which causes a boot loop after the watchdog trips. This can be verified 
with a 'reboot' command on the tension or winch programs which just let 
the watchdog time out. 


For the Nano:
Reload the bootloader using the AVR pocket programmer (set programmer to 
USBtinyISP) by connecting the cables and setting the arduino IDE to use 
the UNO board. This will burn the optiboot bootloader. After running 
'burn bootloader', switch the USB cable back to the target board (from 
the programmer) and remember the leave the IDE set to UNO for this board 
from now on. 


For the Mega2560
Reload the bootloader using the AVR pocket programmer (set programmer to 
USBtinyISP) by connecting the cables and setting the arduino IDE to use 
the Mega2560 board. This will burn the updated mega bootloader. After 
running 'burn bootloader' (there may be verification errors - this is 
due to the memory not being 0xFF as when new and should be fine, but 
double check that is wasn't some other verification error by trying it to 
see if it works), switch the USB cable back to the target board (from 
the programmer).
